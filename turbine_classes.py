    A class to represent a general wind turbine and calculate its power output based on wind speed.

        rotor_diameter (float): The diameter of the rotor in meters.
        hub_height (float): The height of the hub above the ground in meters.
        rated_power (float): The rated power output of the turbine in watts.
        v_in (float): The cut-in wind speed (minimum wind speed for power generation) in m/s.
        v_rated (float): The rated wind speed (wind speed at which the turbine generates its rated power) in m/s.
        v_out (float): The cut-out wind speed (maximum wind speed for safe operation) in m/s.
        name (str, optional): The name or identifier of the wind turbine. Defaults to None.
    Methods:
        get_power(wind_speed):
            Calculates the power output of the turbine based on the given wind speed.
